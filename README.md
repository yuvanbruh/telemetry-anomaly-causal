# Self-Supervised Telemetry Anomaly Detection with Causal Root-Cause Attribution

## Problem
Detect anomalies in multivariate telemetry time-series without labels and identify the root-cause sensors or subsystems.

## Dataset
NASA SMAP / MSL spacecraft telemetry dataset.

## Approach
Learn normal system behavior using self-supervised temporal models and detect deviations with causal attribution.

## Status
Step 0 – Project setup complete.
